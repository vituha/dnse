# Proxomitron banner filter keyword list (NOADDURL)
# 
# This file contains keywords used by the various banner filters
# to detect ads. It also checks the URL killer list.
# Keyword detection can be safer as it only kills image tags
# while the URL killer may kill entire pages.
#
# Note: indented lines are combined with the previous line 
#       to form one expression

# Example (disabled by Russian Edition Team):
#
## Basic Adv keyword regexp
#\w[^a-z0-9](
#    ad(s|v|banner|click|fu|ver|name|log|)[^a-z0-9]|
#    (double|ad|log_)click|
#    click(thru|er|.pl)|
#    phpads|
#    rotator([0-9]+|)|
#    (banner|click|offer|r(ef|un)|s(ite|eed|ource)|pal)(_|)(rand|id|)=|
#    (web|)sponsor|promo|
#    reklama|banner)
