<P class=li><B>A radical new concept in software distribution...</B></P>

<P>The Proxomitron has no time limit, no nag screens, and no registrations keys - all features are full functional now and forever.  It is not Shareware, Demoware, Careware, Crippleware, or even TupperWare™.</P>

<P>Although it's Free, It's not Freeware either.... The Proxomitron is, in fact, <B class=r>Shonenware!</B></P>

<P class=li><B>What the name of PuyoPuyo is Shonenware!!?</B></P>

<P><font class=r>Shonenware</font> is a concept dedicated to the support of the one-and-only, world famous, female power-trio from Osaka Japan <A HREF="Shonen Knife.html"><B>Shonen Knife</B></A> -  kawaii creators of the very best music in the world!</P>

<P>Under the terms of <font class=r>Shonenware</font>, Proxomitron is free for personal use. You can use the program as often as you like for as long as you like. You are under no restriction to stop using it after so many days, or indeed ever! You can also, of course, freely copy it as long as you abide by certain conditions (see below). However, If you find the program useful you're encouraged to "register" it. </P>

<P class=li><B>How to register....</B></P>

<P>To register simply go out and buy any CD, record, or tape by Shonen Knife, listen to it carefully, and <A HREF="Contacts.html">e-mail me your impressions</A> of the album. Be sure to include detailed-enough descriptions of the songs to convince me that you actually *did* buy the album ;-). Alternately, mail (not email - no binary attachments please) me a picture of you holding the CD. If you can convince me you really do own a Shonen Knife album, well, then you're registered. </P>

<P>What? Your local record shop doesn't have any Shonen Knife? Well, then, they must not be a proper bison loving establishment, I say.  Don't fret however, most on-line music stores boast a good selection for sale. If you're new to Shonen Knife and don't know where to start, I recommend <I>"Brand New Knife"</I> as an excellent first choice. <I>"Let's Knife"</I> is also a perennial favorite. </P>

<P>If you're already a fan of Shonen Knife and perhaps own some (or all) of their albums, you're already qualified for registration!</P>

<P>If, on the off chance, you actually happen to <I>be</I> Shonen Knife (i.e. Naoko, Atsuko, or Michie), you of course, have a lifetime registration for this and any other Shonenware releases.  Sadly, I hear tell they all use Macs ;-).</P>

<P>I should also mention I'm in no way affiliated with Shonen Knife. The only benefit I receive is by encouraging a band whose music I enjoy, and hopefully helping others to discover this unique group too.</P>

<P class=li><B>Why register...</B></P>

<P>Although not required, Registration accomplishes they following nifty things.</P>

<ol>
<li>It makes me happy (because I like Shonen Knife)!
<li>It makes Shonen Knife happy and allows them to make more albums which...
<li>It makes the entire world a happier place!
<li>And most importantly, it can make <B><I>you</I></B> happy since it results in owning a magical Shonen Knife album of <B><I>your very own!</I></B>
</ol>

<P>Now, how often does registering a program give you the chance to improve the entire world? ;-) </P>


<P class=li><B>Legalese...</B></P>
