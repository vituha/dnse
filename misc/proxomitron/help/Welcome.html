<P>Welcome to Proxomitron Naoko 4.5! If you're new to the program, this page will help you get the ball rolling (if you like rolling balls, that is).

<p>After installing, you'll also need to change your browsers <a href="Installation.html#proxy">proxy settings</a> before it'll do anything besides look vaguely disorienting. This is pretty easy to do though - read on to find out how.

<UL>
<LI><P>First, a word of caution: <B class="r">Use Proxomitron At Your Own Risk!</B><br>

<P>I've tried to make Proxomitron a safe and useful program, but I can make no guarantees. It's provided solely "AS IS" - Please read <a href="License.html">the user license</a> for details.
<P>

<LI><P>If you're not too sure what the heck this thing does, please read this short <a href="Intro.html">introduction</a>.<P>

<LI><P>If you've decided Proxomitron is worth a try, next go on to read <B>"<A href="Installation.html">Installation and Eradication</a>"</B> - especially the bits about how to set your browser's proxy to use Proxomitron.  <B class=r>This is very important - otherwise the program won't do diddly</B> (though it may, in fact, do squat).
<P>

<LI><P>Also keep in mind Proxomitron by default runs as an icon in your <a href="System Tray.html">system tray</a> (usually  at the bottom right of your screen). This is where you go to configure the program.
<P>

</OL>

<P>That should get you started. You can read the full <a href="Contents.html">help file</a> at any time by selecting the "Help" option from Proxomitron's <a href="Mainscreen.html">main window</a> or pressing F1 on any dialog box. 

<P class=ind>I hope you enjoy this little program of mine...
