To make them safer, you can enter a short word here.

However, as a proxy it can be accessed remotely (perhaps by other PC's on your LAN).  Click this to set a range of IP addresses you wish to allow give to. Please be careful though - you take a risk by doing this! In most cases it's better to simply run a copy of Proxomitron on each PC. (Note: you'll need to save your settings restart Proxomitron for this to take effect).";

var t3_limit="<B>Limit access to only this PC</b><p>This is the default, and safest, option. When this is selected only programs running locally on your PC can access Proxomitron. Don't change this without good reason (and a good firewall wouldn't hurt either).";

<P class=li><B>The "Access" Tab</B></P>

<P>This allows you to allow PCs other than your own to access Proxomitron.  Just specify a starting and ending IP address rage to allow in.</P>

<p><B class=r>BEWARE</B> This is dangerous!  Allow access only if you have a good reason too (and preferably a good firewall to boot). In most cases it's better to just run multiple copies of Proxomitron on each PC.

<P>If you do, you may want to <b>disable URL commands</b> so remote users can't cause trouble.  Keep in mind URL commands you can load files remotely or change the current config - make sure they're only available to PCs you control.  At the very least be sure to create a custom <B>Prefix</B> to use before all URL commands.  This can act as a simple password since no URL command will work unless it's preceded with the prefix you choose.</P>
